##  Overview

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; Authentication & authorization are 2 of the main security goals of IT systems and should not be used interchangibly. Simply put, during authentication the system verifies the identity of a user or service, and during authorization the system checks the access rights, optionally based on a given user role.

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; There are multiple types of authentication based on the implementation mechanism or the data provided by the user. Some usual ones would be the following:

- Based on credentials (Username/Password);

- Multi-Factor Authentication (2FA, MFA);

- Based on digital certificates;

- Based on biometrics;

- Based on tokens.

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; Regarding authorization, the most popular mechanisms are the following:

- Role Based Access Control (RBAC): Base on the role of a user;

- Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC): Based on a characteristic/attribute of a user.

##  Objectives:

1. Put the previous laboratory works in a web service / several web services.

2. The services should have implemented basic authentication and MFA.

3. The web app needs to simulate user authorization, and the way the user is authorized.

4. As services can be used, the classical ciphers. Basically, the user would like to get access and use the classical ciphers, but they need to authenticate and be authorized.
